Citrine is a Java web application which can be used to configure, manage and monitor the running of various tasks (typically, but not limited to, shell scripts). It can be thought of as a GUI replacement for cron with extra functionality. It can also be thought of as a GUI for the Java Quartz Scheduler ("citrine" is a type of quartz).
