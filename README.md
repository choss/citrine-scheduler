**Citrine** is a Java web application which can be used to configure, manage and monitor the running of various tasks (typically, but not limited to, shell scripts). It can be thought of as a GUI replacement for cron with extra functionality. It can also be thought of as a GUI for the [Java Quartz Scheduler](http://quartz-scheduler.org/) ("citrine" is a type of quartz).

Citrine can be [downloaded here](https://code.google.com/p/citrine-scheduler/downloads/list).

Please refer to the project's [Wiki](https://github.com/massdosage/citrine-scheduler/wiki) for usage and other information.
